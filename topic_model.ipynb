Each row and column corresponds to a particular topic, and the color of each cell reflects the degree of semantic similarity between those two topics. Darker cells along the diagonal indicate higher self-similarity (a topic compared to itself), while off-diagonal cells reveal how related (or unrelated) different topics are.\n",

Topics that share conceptual ground, such as “Bandit Algorithms” and “Reinforcement Learning Policies”, appear in regions of higher similarity, suggesting that the language used to describe them overlaps significantly. Conversely, less closely related topics have lower similarity scores, appearing in lighter-colored cells. Note that the results below might differ from the examples described, due to the stochastic nature of the topic model and the LLM outputs."
